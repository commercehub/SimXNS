# SimXNS Project
This repo provides the code of SimANS. In the paper, we propose a simple, general and flexible ambiguous negatives sampling method for dense text retrieval. It can be easily applied to various dense retrieval methods.

This repo is still developing, feel free to report bugs and we will fix them.
